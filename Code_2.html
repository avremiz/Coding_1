  <h1>My Second Coding Page.</h1>

  <p>Which also happens to be linked to the first.</p>

  <p>Although the source for this page is in the same folder as the source for the main page.</p>

  <p>
    you can link to a file outside of the folder that nests the source of the page that you're on, in two ways: One, you can go DOWN the directory line to the target folder/file. Two, going UP the directory line to the target folder/file. 
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to go down, simply name the folder-name(s) and then the file-name with a forward slash in between each folder <code><a href="code_folder_2/code_3.html">folder/filename.html</a></code>
  </p>
