	<h1>My Third Coding Page.</h1>

	<p>Which also happens to be linked to the first.</p>

    <p>The source of this page is in ANOTHER folder that is nested in the folder which is the source for the main page.</p>

    <p>
    you can link to a file outside of the folder that nests the source of the page that you're on, in two ways: One, you can go DOWN the directory line to the target folder/file. Two, going UP the directory line to the target folder/file. 
    </p>

    <p>Going up the directory, simply type two dots, a forward slash and repeat until the target folder/file is reached 
    <code><a href="../code_2.html">../name_of_folder.html</a></code></p>
